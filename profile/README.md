# AU-ENVS-PhD
## Hi there ðŸ‘‹! welcome to the github homepage for PhD students at the department of Environmental Science in Aarhus University. 


You can find some useful templates in the organization. We also prepared some useful resources here:

## Latex Learning Resources
- [Learn LaTeX in 30 minutes](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes): Useful link if you have never used latex before.
- [Marking changes in pdf](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/Using_Latexdiff_For_Marking_Changes_To_Tex_Documents): this is the most important thing to learn when you're reply to reviewers and would like to mark changes in pdf automatically! 

## Latex 
Different journals have different requirements. Below are some latex packages/commands and tools that may be helpful to your writing! 
1. add line numbers 
```latex
\usepackage{lineno}
\linenumbers
```
2. define line space
```latex
\linespread{1.5}
```
3. define page margin (e.g., 2.5cm margin space)
```latex
\usepackage[margin=2.5cm]{geometry}
```
4. [Excel2Latex extension](https://github.com/ivankokan/Excel2LaTeX)
5. Feel free to share and contribute! To be continued.
